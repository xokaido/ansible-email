## Ansible eMail Server Setup

This repository provisions the email servers with 
MariaDB, Dovecot and Postfix.

It works both with Ubuntu and CentOS systems



Before running the playbook ensure the ```hosts``` file
contains correct server addresses

The usage is like this:

./run.sh
