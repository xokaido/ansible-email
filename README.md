## Ansible eMail Server Setup

This repository provisions the email servers with 
```MariaDB```, ```Dovecot``` and ```Postfix```.

It should be working both with ```Ubuntu``` and ```CentOS``` systems



Before running the playbook ensure the ```hosts``` file
contains correct server addresses

The usage is like this:

`./run.sh`

For usernames, databases and passwords check the ```./group_vars/all``` file.
